It's not easy reformatting a book that was originally made for print into something that works in a web browser. Thus far I'm six chapters in and figured that was enough to go ahead with launching the site.

If you'd like to know more about what's going on around here, please take the time to read the new [**About**](http://www.jetadams.com/about/) page. It'll give you a brief (though somewhat vague) history. Or, if you're the kind of person who wants to jump right into the deep end, please feel free to [**browse my works**](http://www.jetadams.com/works/) and read to your hearts content.

I've done what I can to minimize overhead for this site. At least that way I won't be *losing* money. Of course, if you like what you read, please feel free to hit one of the prominently displayed donation buttons. You can send me any amount of change you like via Paypal.

And finally, **thank you**! I make no claim to being a great writer, but I do love writing. If not for readers like you, these characters would be trapped alone in my cranium forever. Thank you for giving them their freedom.
